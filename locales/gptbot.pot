"                     Bot instruction:\n"
"     💬 Dialogue - the bot gives a non-detailed answer (although it is enough in most cases), but remembers replicas and, therefore, understands the context. For example, you can ask \"What is a cell?\", and if  you write to the bot \"Do you like it?\" after the answer, it will give an information about the cell.\n"
"     ❔ Detailed answer - the bot does not remember replicas, that is, it will not understand the context of the conversation. However, the maximum possible answer can be 2 times more than in the \"Dialogue\" mode. Useful if you are not going to develop the topic, but want to get a detailed answer."
